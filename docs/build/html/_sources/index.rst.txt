Rebound-API documentation
=========================

The Rebound API is a mock version of a real proprietary API and RFID-driven platform used for realtime inventory tracking in remote mining and oil & gas production locations. It is intended as a documentation portfolio piece *only* and has been scrubbed of certain details for security purposes.
